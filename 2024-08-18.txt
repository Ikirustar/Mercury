I never let myself fall too deep into dogma, because of my obsession of questioning boundries. A lot of rules and practices are done because of tradition and ease. But the thrill I experience as soon as a crack reveals itself is great. Rather than getting stuck on the traditional pathway of success, understand that other possibilities exist. A company does not need investments and scalability for exmployees for instance. Some have a single man with the use of external resources/servers, get user input in a targeted/calculated manner in which drives the buisiness model. A good startup does not prematurely use the best technologies that may equate to good engineering. But instead, use scalable standardized frameworks/services that are easiest to work with. Examples include PHP, and cheap private virtual networks for hosting. To push this point to the test however, what if its possible to use/develop powerful tools, while not designed for company usage, could perfectly work given a sufficient internally developed buisiness model. The same way how apple developed its pricing information systems to know how much the machontosh costs by the dollar. Right now, my heart is too damaged to throw myself in the community again. And one day, I do want to reach a point where I can go out and shake people's hands again. Right now though, I will transition slowly, with the development of my works. Improve the net growth and contribute to the pie rather than take from it. A huge piece of contention that I have with the community, is the lack of nuturing for the big picture. Most of us want to live our lives for success and quality experience, but thats simply due to the amazingly sufficient structure that allows us to do so. But that structure can't last if nobody maintains it. My hope with my work, we can restore that care and go further beyond. asddasfdsafds
