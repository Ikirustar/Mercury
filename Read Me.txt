Purpose: 

Putting in data from obsidian and using ai to pull the best ideas at the right circumstance. Helps user's implant the best thought generaters to produce good thought bubbles.
If people get exposed to something for more than 4 months, it typically becomes a part of them. This program will use that, and constantly bring up the best ideas based on
what the user wants. It will be a good planning tool for basic task managment, and predictive modeling/machine learning. 

Features:

- Built in note taking functionality.
- Import obsidian vaults/onenote/txt files. 
	- This will be basis for what ideas the AI pulls. Random ideas or ideologies I may have forgotten about, could be useful on a certain day.
	- Reminders could also be stored, and they could be brought up again.
	- Activities, circumstances, could be brought up again by ai (If I somehow forget what I am currently enrolled in or whatnot).
		- Might be a good idea to just have a small sql server database with this stuff.
- AI integegration using langchain and API key. GPT4 will be used for now
	-  google gemeni on the lookout.
- Basic data analytics functionality. Putting in data and using matplotlib to display data. 
	- Data agregation and cleaning tools also provided
	- Regression modeling, Linear interpolation, ect
- Basic planning functionality and checklists

Tools:


Python

Libraries:

- Langchain with an API Key to use GPT 4 (Looking into google gemini, as that outperforms GPT4 for the most part)
- Custom Tkinter 
	- GUI library to help display the program
- Matplotlib 
	- Displaying dataframes through graphing.


-Custom tkinter notes
	- If multiple columns have the the same attributes except for the index, they can be put together using (0, 1, 2, ect).
	- Weight influences how big the row/column is compared to the rest.
	- Grid rowspan/columnspan, can make the widget span across multiple rows/columns.
	- padx/pady is the outside space, ipadx/ipady is the space within the widget
